# **Beyond the Chart – Quantitative & Structural Integrity Report**

### **BTCQ Research Series 2025 | Institutional Quantitative Framework**

*Authored by Beyond the Chart Research Division*

## **1. Executive Overview**

This repository contains the full quantitative and structural assessment of a high-frequency algorithmic trading account analyzed under the **Beyond the Chart Quantitative & Behavioral Framework**.

The study integrates more than **30 quantitative and structural metrics**, including *Edge Decay Analysis, Risk of Ruin Forecasting, Monte Carlo Simulation, Root Cause Diagnostics,* and *Drawdown Integrity Testing*.

While the performance profile of the account appears remarkably stable, the underlying data pattern suggests **structural compression and synthetic smoothness** inconsistent with live market conditions.

## **2. Methodology**

The analysis was conducted using the proprietary **Beyond the Chart Quantitative Framework**, combining classical financial metrics with advanced statistical and temporal diagnostics.

**Modules included:**
- **Core KPI Metrics:** CAGR, Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Gain-to-Pain, Profit Factor, R/R Ratio  
- **Tail Risk & Stability Metrics:** Skewness, Kurtosis, Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR (CVaR)  
- **Equity Consistency Metrics:** Rolling Expectancy, Volatility Adaptation, Equity Drawdown Curve  
- **Root Cause Matrix:** Correlation between Sharpe, Win Rate, Trade Size, and Drawdown  
- **Edge Decay Timeline:** Rolling Sharpe & Sortino dynamics, regression-based decay trend  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** 1,000 randomized reshuffle runs with distribution fan charts  
- **Risk of Ruin Model:** Probabilistic exposure forecasting and survival probability estimation  
- **Hidden Exposure Metrics:** Real vs Broker-Limited drawdown and Self-Destruction Index  

All computations are derived directly from the trade-level data provided in the CSV report, ensuring full transparency and replicability.

## **3. Key Findings**

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Interpretation** |
|-------------|------------|--------------------|
| Win Rate | **93.2%** | Exceptionally high, typical of grid or averaging strategies |
| R/R Ratio | **0.39** | Indicates asymmetric exposure with limited reward per trade |
| Max Drawdown | **2.1%** | Statistically improbable under real CFD execution |
| CAGR | **48.3%** | Unrealistic compounded growth given market friction |
| Sharpe Ratio | **3.27** | Elevated stability under unrealistically consistent volatility |
| Sortino Ratio | **5.01** | Suggests synthetic downside suppression |
| Edge Decay Slope | **-0.00042** | Gradual but clear degradation of strategy efficiency |
| Operational Resilience (ORS) | **88.4 / 100** | Mechanically stable, typical of automated execution |
| Self-Destruction Index | **1.00** | Indicates no real market friction — static execution environment |

The collective signal points to an **algorithmically consistent but environmentally artificial system** — highly optimized under controlled conditions, yet detached from the volatility dynamics of live markets.

## **4. Structural Integrity Assessment**

A detailed comparison between *real-equity reconstruction* and a *broker-limited proxy* highlights minimal drawdown fluctuation and constant margin usage.  
This stability pattern, while idealized, is **rarely achievable in authentic retail or institutional CFD execution**, where spread and commission introduce natural variance.

The **Root Cause Correlation Matrix** further confirms the dominance of structural dependency over behavioral influence:

| **Correlation Pair** | **ρ** | **Interpretation** |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------|
| Sharpe ↔ Win Rate | +0.71 | High internal consistency typical of mechanical grids |
| Sharpe ↔ Drawdown | −0.64 | Negative structural correlation; volatility suppresses returns |
| Sharpe ↔ Trade Size | −0.52 | Suggests reactive sizing logic rather than true risk adaptation |

These dynamics are consistent with **synthetic performance reconstruction** or **IB-level account manipulation** for marketing demonstration purposes.

## **5. Edge Decay Analysis**

The *Edge Decay Timeline* reveals a controlled but measurable weakening of edge efficiency:

- **Edge Strength regression slope:** -0.00042  
- **Correlation coefficient (r):** -0.68  
- **Decay pattern:** Gradual loss of profitability during volatility expansion periods  

This indicates that while the system remains functional under stable volatility regimes, its *edge collapses progressively* in stressed or shifting environments — a hallmark of structurally overfit algorithms.

## **6. Monte Carlo & Ruin Probability**

1,000 reshuffle simulations were performed to test the robustness of the system under randomized trade sequences.

- **Expected Final Equity:** €29,480  
- **5–95% Interval:** [€25,260 – €33,980]  
- **Simulated Probability of Ruin (−70% equity):** <1%  

While the model appears statistically resilient, its uniformity across simulations suggests *data homogenization* rather than genuine market adaptability.

---

## **7. Final Interpretation**

This trading system demonstrates:
- Exceptional short-term precision and consistency;
- Strong mechanical resilience under fixed conditions;
- A complete absence of natural market noise or liquidity friction.

Such behavior is **typical of demo or synthetic datasets** used for marketing or proof-of-concept purposes rather than authentic live performance.

---

> ### **Summary Verdict**
> The algorithm displays **logical internal coherence** but **environmental artificiality**.  
> The account should not be considered *live or market-validated*.  
> Performance metrics reflect **optimized simulation output**, not real-world execution.
