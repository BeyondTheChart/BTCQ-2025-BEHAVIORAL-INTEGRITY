# Beyond the Chart – Quantitative & Behavioral Analysis Framework

### Edge Decay and Behavioral Integrity Assessment – Professional Overview  
*Authored by Beyond the Chart Research Division*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents a professional-grade quantitative and behavioral assessment of a high-frequency trading strategy characterized by a 93.2% win rate and a mean risk/reward ratio of 0.39.  
The analysis, conducted under the proprietary *Beyond the Chart Quantitative & Behavioral Framework*, aims to determine the authenticity, resilience, and sustainability of the underlying trading edge over time.

The study integrates advanced quantitative metrics with behavioral modeling to reveal the structural stability, operational coherence, and probabilistic decay of the strategy's performance under realistic market conditions.

Key findings suggest a high degree of algorithmic optimization but raise significant doubts regarding execution authenticity and environmental realism.

## 2. Methodology & Data Integrity

The analysis applies a multi-dimensional quantitative and behavioral framework integrating:

- **Edge Strength and Decay Metrics:** Rolling Sharpe-Adjusted Equity Analysis  
- **Ulcer Performance Index (UPI)** and **Operational Resilience Score (ORS)**  
- **Payoff Consistency, Win-Rate Distribution, Gain-to-Pain Ratio**  
- **Volatility-Adjusted Drawdown and Self-Destruction Index (SDI)**  
- **Behavior vs Structure Mutual Information Model (MI)**  
- **Edge Equilibrium & Decay Timeline Forecasting (ARIMA, CUSUM)**  

Data were sourced from an FXBlue performance report and cross-referenced with Myfxbook logs.  
No broker-level execution data (spread, commission, slippage) were available, which limits liquidity-adjusted validation.

## 3. Extended Quantitative Metrics

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Interpretation** |
|-------------|------------|--------------------|
| **Win Rate** | 93.2% | Exceptional precision; atypical in real CFD markets |
| **Average Risk/Reward Ratio** | 0.39 | Asymmetric exposure with high frequency and low per-trade efficiency |
| **Profit Factor (PF)** | 1.72 | Acceptable efficiency, but low robustness for institutional standards |
| **CAGR (Annualized Growth)** | 48.3% | Unrealistic given minimal drawdown; indicates synthetic curve |
| **Max Drawdown (Real)** | 2.1% | Statistically improbable under real spread and slippage |
| **Max Drawdown (Broker-Limited)** | 1.8% | Artificial compression; frictionless execution |
| **Ulcer Index (UI)** | 0.64 | Extremely low; signals smoothed equity behavior |
| **UPI (Ulcer Performance Index)** | 1.87 | Apparent stability inconsistent with stochastic volatility |
| **Gain-to-Pain Ratio (GPR)** | 2.94 | Over-optimized distribution; lacks natural trade variance |
| **Sortino Ratio** | 4.26 | Outstanding but statistically improbable for live CFD |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 3.81 | Indicates perfect calibration under synthetic volatility |
| **Calmar Ratio** | 22.9 | Unrealistically high; suggests equity smoothing |
| **Edge Decay Slope** | -0.00042 | Slow but consistent decline in performance edge |
| **Edge Health** | 94.6% | Stable edge, likely maintained by tight algorithmic control |
| **Self-Destruction Index (SDI)** | 1.00 | Implies total absence of adaptive volatility response |
| **Operational Resilience Score (ORS)** | 88.4 / 100 | High resilience under synthetic stress testing |
| **Edge Stability Variance (ESV)** | 0.011 | Minimal deviation – indicates artificial control |
| **Payoff Ratio Variance (PRV)** | 0.023 | Under-dispersed; suggests smoothing of loss cycles |
| **Equity Skewness** | 0.19 | Balanced equity curve, inconsistent with typical CFD skew |
| **Excess Kurtosis** | -1.78 | Flat-tailed distribution, typical of data aggregation |
| **Tail Risk (CVaR 95%)** | -0.34% | Unrealistically narrow loss tail |

## 4. Behavioral-Structural Diagnostics

The *Behavior vs Structure Model* quantifies non-linear dependencies between human and algorithmic components via **mutual information regression (MI)**:

| **Category** | **Influence (%)** | **Dominant Factors** |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Behavioral** | 31% | Overtrading variance and adaptive sizing instability |
| **Structural** | 69% | Fixed-volatility regime and grid-based exposure control |

These results confirm **algorithmic dominance** with negligible human input.  
Behavioral activity appears suppressed, consistent with full automation and rule-based logic loops.

---

## 5. Risk & Stress Metrics

| **Stress Test** | **Result** | **Interpretation** |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------|
| **Sortino Stress Test x2** | 1.97 → 0.94 | Severe sensitivity to downside amplification |
| **Monte Carlo Variance (1000 Runs)** | 0.82% | Extremely narrow terminal dispersion |
| **Simulated Probability of Ruin (30% Capital)** | 0.7% | Unrealistic; lacks drawdown persistence |
| **Value at Risk (VaR 95%)** | -0.29% | Tight distribution; likely synthetic spread |
| **Conditional VaR (CVaR 95%)** | -0.34% | Smoothed loss curve |
| **Max Recovery Factor** | 10.8 | Anomalously high; suggests curve fitting |
| **Edge Collapse Detection (CUSUM)** | 3 critical points | Matches volatility regime shifts |
| **Page-Hinkley Change Points** | 2 | Confirms partial adaptation logic |

## 6. Edge Decay Evaluation

**Rolling Edge Strength Regression** reveals progressive weakening under volatility expansion.  
- **Decay Slope:** -0.00042  
- **Volatility Correlation:** -0.68  
- **Decay Type:** Slow exponential  

### Edge Collapse Root Cause
- **Sharpe-to-WinRate Corr:** +0.73  
- **Sharpe-to-Drawdown Corr:** -0.61  
- **Sharpe-to-Trade Size Corr:** -0.55  

> **Diagnosis:** structural rigidity amplified by mean-reversion exposure and risk grid feedback.

## 7. Professional Interpretation

- Short-term mechanical consistency typical of grid EAs under synthetic latency.  
- Drawdown compression indicates absence of real-market friction.  
- ORS and UPI values suggest frictionless execution.  
- 1.00 SDI value confirms static spread-free operation.  
- Data smoothing and drawdown symmetry imply third-party aggregation or demo-server generation.

These findings are consistent with **non-live or semi-simulated environments** — e.g., IB-level execution feeds or demo algorithmic backtests.

## 8. Framework Reference

All metrics, regressions, and diagnostics were produced using the *Beyond the Chart Quantitative & Behavioral Analysis Framework* integrating:

- **Quantitative Layer:** Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Gain-to-Pain, Ulcer, CVaR  
- **Structural Layer:** Edge Decay, ORS, SDI, Rolling Payoff Variance  
- **Behavioral Layer:** Overtrading, Loss Aversion, Position Size Volatility  
- **Attribution Layer:** Mutual Information Matrix (Behavior vs Structure)  
- **Temporal Layer:** Edge Equilibrium Timeline and CUSUM Event Map  

This unified model bridges **quantitative finance** and **behavioral analytics**, identifying when a trading system’s performance diverges from realistic stochastic expectations.
