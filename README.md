Beyond the Chart – Quantitative & Behavioral Analysis Framework
Edge Decay and Behavioral Integrity Assessment – Institutional Overview

Authored by Beyond the Chart Research Division

1. Executive Summary

This document presents an institutional-grade quantitative and behavioral assessment of a high-frequency trading strategy characterized by a 93.2% win rate and a mean risk/reward ratio of 0.39. The analysis, conducted under the proprietary Beyond the Chart Quantitative & Behavioral Framework, aims to determine the authenticity, resilience, and sustainability of the underlying trading edge over time.

The study integrates traditional quantitative metrics with behavioral modeling to reveal the structural stability, operational coherence, and probabilistic decay of the strategy's performance under realistic market conditions.

Key findings suggest a high degree of operational optimization but raise significant doubts regarding execution authenticity and environmental realism.

2. Methodology & Data Integrity

The analysis applies a multi-dimensional quantitative and behavioral framework integrating:

Edge Strength and Decay Metrics: Rolling Sharpe-Adjusted Equity Analysis

Operational Resilience Score (ORS) and Ulcer Performance Index (UPI)

Payoff Consistency, Win-Rate Distribution, and Gain-to-Pain Ratio

Behavior vs Structure Mutual Information Model

Edge Equilibrium & Decay Timeline Forecasting

Data were sourced from a trading performance report originally hosted on FXBlue and cross-referenced with equivalent Myfxbook logs where applicable. The dataset includes cumulative trade-level profit/loss records but excludes broker-side execution metadata (spread, commission, slippage), preventing a full liquidity-adjusted replication.

3. Core Quantitative Metrics
Metric	Value	Interpretation
Win Rate	93.2%	Exceptional precision; atypical in live CFD markets
Avg R/R Ratio	0.39	Asymmetric exposure; high frequency with low per-trade efficiency
Max Drawdown	2.1%	Statistically anomalous; suggests synthetic conditions
CAGR	48.3%	Compounded growth unrealistic without significant risk
Edge Decay Slope	-0.00042	Gradual degradation under stress regimes
ORS (Resilience)	88.4 / 100	High internal stability, likely algorithmic control
Self-Destruction Index	1.00	Indicates unrealistically static operating conditions
Edge Health	94.6%	Consistent but artificially smooth performance curve
4. Behavioral-Structural Diagnostics

The Behavior vs Structure Model employs mutual information regression to evaluate the degree of non-linear dependency between behavioral variables (Overtrading, Loss Aversion, Size Volatility) and structural factors (Volatility Regime, Drawdown Stress, Sharpe Decay).

Category	Influence (%)	Dominant Factors
Behavioral	31%	Overtrading variance and adaptive sizing instability
Structural	69%	Fixed-volatility regime and grid-based structural persistence

The results confirm algorithmic control with limited human interference. Behavioral signals are suppressed, aligning with an automated decision-making process that follows rigid logic sequences with negligible cognitive deviation.

5. Edge Decay Evaluation

The Edge Decay analysis measures rolling Sharpe-adjusted returns to identify structural fatigue, instability, and collapse points.

Edge Trend Slope: -0.00042 → indicates gradual loss of efficiency.

Correlation with Volatility Regime: -0.68 → negative correlation; strategy deteriorates during volatility expansions.

Edge Equilibrium Map: reveals multiple transitions between structural and behavioral dominance, consistent with adaptive but fragile algorithmic design.

The data suggest a bubble-type structure—performance remains stable until stress conditions trigger exponential degradation.

6. Professional Interpretation

The account’s performance profile and decay topology indicate the following:

The system demonstrates short-term mechanical consistency typical of grid or mean-reversion EAs operating under synthetic spreads.

Drawdown compression and constant margin utilization imply absence of real-market friction, inconsistent with retail CFD cost structures.

The 1.00 Self-Destruction Index indicates static exposure—no adaptive volatility or liquidity response.

Report patterns and time clusters reveal data smoothing, likely introduced via platform-level aggregation or third-party manipulation.

These findings are consistent with non-live or partially simulated environments (e.g., broker demo servers, IB-level backtesting modules, or API-fed synthetic feeds).

7. Conclusions

The analyzed trading account exhibits a statistically coherent yet operationally implausible performance pattern. While the strategy may exist as a genuine algorithm, its execution environment is almost certainly non-realistic.

Summary Verdict: The edge is logically valid but environmentally artificial.
The account performance cannot be considered proof-of-performance under live market conditions.

The framework concludes that this strategy represents a conceptual demonstration of precision trading logic, not an example of real-world, friction-inclusive execution.

8. Framework Reference

All computations, visualizations, and metrics in this document were produced using the Beyond the Chart Quantitative & Behavioral Analysis Framework, a proprietary analytical suite integrating:

Statistical robustness metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Gain-to-Pain)

Behavioral correlation matrices (mutual information models)

Structural decay forecasting (Edge Strength regression)

Psychological attribution maps (Behavior vs Structure equilibrium)

This framework aims to merge quantitative analytics with behavioral finance principles to provide a comprehensive diagnosis of trading system sustainability.
